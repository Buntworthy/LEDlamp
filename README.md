LED lamp
======
Code for an LED lamp

Hardware
------
Powered by:

* Raspberry Pi
* Fadecandy
* 120 addressable RGB LEDs (WS2812B)
* Some wire and connectors
* Some hard things yet to be decided on

Aim
------
LED lamp to display colours and change, probably talks
to the internet somehow and controllable over the web.

Progress
------
*Currently:*
Displaying single colours (with some noise), fades between
other colours at random intervals.

*Next:*
Make the colour change controllable, and introduce spatial
correlation on delay of colour changes.
